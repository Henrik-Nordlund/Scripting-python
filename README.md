I have solved all the puzzles on the website codingbat with python as the chosen programming language.
The solutions are saved as python files, but opening them will not execute any code.
The reason being that typically codingbat require for a specific puzzle to create a function that solves a specific task.
Since that function is not called upon within a proper program, nothing will happen.

In addition I have added a description on how to open an external file, manipulate it and finally close the now updated file using python. 

I prefer VS Code myself, but you might as well use a simple texteditor such as notepad or something (instead of an IDE) if you want to check it out.
Where I think I it is appropriate I have added short comments.
