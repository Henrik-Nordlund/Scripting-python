I have solved all the puzzles on the website codingbat with python as the chosen programming language.
The solutions are saved as python files, but opening them will not execute any code.
The reason being that typically codingbat require for a specific puzzle to create a function that a specific task.
Since that function is not called upon a proper program, nothing will happen.

I prefer VS Code myself, but you might as well as use a simple texteditor such as notepad or something if you want to check it out.
Where I think I it is appropriate I have added short comments.
